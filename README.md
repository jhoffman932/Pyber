Three Trends of Ride Sharing
1.	The first trend I observed was that getting a Pyber in urban areas was more common than in the suburbs and rural areas, with over 68.4% of rides being in the city.


2 .One trend that surprised me was that on average itâ€™s less expensive to get a ride in the city compared to the suburbs and rural areas.  Even though 68.4% of the Pybers were in urban areas, they only accounted for 62.7% of the total fares.

3.	The high concentration of drivers in urban areas also stuck out to me.  According to the data, 86.7% of driver work in urban areas and only 13.3% of drivers serve the suburbs and rural areas.  It would seem being a driver outside urban areas would be more profitable since they have less competition and higher fare rates.
